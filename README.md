- [HTML/CSS] - Obviously!!
- [Three.js] - Star of the show!! âœ¨âœ¨

## Installation
Start with setting up your own MySQL server and acquire url, username and password.
After doing that fork this repo and continue with IDE of your choice. 

### Backend (Spring Boot)
Locate the `application.properties` file and do the following changes:
```
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:<YOUR_CONNECTION_URL>?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=<YOUR_USERNAME>
spring.datasource.password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
```
Run the project in your IDE and "Voila! Your REST APIs are up and running". (I hope!ðŸ˜‰ ). Now acquire the endpoint_url and proceed with the setup.

### Frontend (Angular App)
Locate `FileUploadService#baseUrl` and change the endpoint with the endpoint_url we got when we were setting up the backend.

Start with:
```
npm install
```
Followed by:
```
ng serve
```
Note: Please make sure, you have **npm** and **angular-cli** presiding in your system.
